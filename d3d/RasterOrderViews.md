# Feature Summary

Expose hardware support for Rasterizer Ordered Views (ROVs), which allow
Pixel Shader code to mark UAV bindings with a declaration that alters
the requirements of [Section 4.2 Fixed Order of Pipeline Results](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/archive/D3D11_3_FunctionalSpec.htm#4.2%20Fixed%20Order%20of%20Pipeline%20Results) for
UAVs, guaranteeing order of UAV accesses for any pair of overlapping
Pixel Shader invocations.

## Semantics

Rasterizer Ordered Views (ROVs) allow Pixel Shader code to mark UAV
bindings with a declaration that alters the requirements of the D3D11 spec section "Fixed Order of Pipeline Results for UAVs", guaranteeing order of UAV
accesses for any pair of overlapping Pixel Shader invocations.
"Overlapping" means that the invocations are generated by the same
Draw\* API call and share the same pixel coordinate when in
pixel-frequency execution mode, and same pixel and sample coordinate in
sample-frequency mode. The order in which overlapping Pixel Shader
invocations' ROV accesses are executed must be the order in which the
geometry was submitted (see the D3D11 spec section "Fixed Order of Pipeline
Results"). This means that, for overlapping Pixel Shader invocations, ROV
writes performed by a Pixel Shader invocation must be available to read
by a subsequent invocation and must not affect reads by a previous
invocation, and ROV reads performed by a Pixel Shader invocation must
reflect writes by a previous invocation and must not reflect writes by a
subsequent invocation. This is important for UAVs because they are
explicitly omitted from the output-invariance guarantees provided by "Fixed order Of Pipeline Results".

## Architectural Overview

ROVs is an optional feature. It will only be supported on WDDM 2.0 or
newer UMDs that support FL11.1+. Its runtime implementation fits well
into our existing code:

- Checking whether this feature is supported will integrate into our
    existing CheckFeatureSupport functionality with both an API check
    and DDI check.
- Our existing Create Shader validation will be modified to validate
    that the hardware supports this feature if a Pixel Shader attempts
    to use it.

---

## Architecture Decisions

WDDM 2.0+, D3D FL11.1+ is required to support this feature.

Support for this new format feature will fit into the existing format
support structures, data, and logic.

---

# Detailed Design

---

## Check Feature Support

ID3D11Device CheckFeatureSupport API is used to determine support.
This will be implemented much like the design of Buffer Map Default, so
the implementation of that and CheckFeatureSupport() for
D3D11_FEATURE_D3D11_OPTIONS1 can be referenced.

This feature support information should be grouped with the other
features being added to the runtimes (e.g. ASTC Profile) into something
like D3D11_FEATURE_D3D11_OPTIONS2.

Only FL11.1+ WDDM 2.0+ drivers will have the ability to support ROVs,
and must support a shader cap query for it. Drivers that don't meet the
FL and WDDM requirement will default to no support.

The relevant new D3D11_FEATURE:

```C++
D3D11_FEATURE_D3D11_OPTIONS2 = ( D3D11_FEATURE_MARKER_SUPPORT + 1)
```

Associated Structure and Capability member:

```C++
typedef struct D3D11_FEATURE_DATA_D3D11_OPTIONS2 {
    // other caps...
    BOOL ROVSupported;
} D3D11_FEATURE_DATA_D3D11_OPTIONS2;
```

This BOOL will only be set when the driver specifies support via the
D3D11DDI_SHADER_CAPS, much like shader double support is set
currently. To be more specific, ROVSupported defaults to FALSE, and is
only set to TRUE when:

- UMD version \>= WDDM 2.0
- HighWaterMarkFeatureLevel \>= FL11.1
- UMD sets the appropriate cap in D3D11DDI_SHADER_CAPS

## API Changes

None.

## Validation

---

### D3D11

CreatePixelShader() validation will mimic
SHADER_FEATURE_DOUBLES/m_bDoublePrecisionFloatShaderOpsSupported
validation. A new Shader Feature flag must be added to the
SShaderFeatureInfo FeatureFlags in order for runtime to properly
validate. If that new Shader Feature flag is set for a given Pixel
Shader, then the driver must have set support for
D3D11DDICAPS_SHADER_ROVS.

---

### D3D12

CreatePixelShader() validation will be very similar D3D11's.

---

## DDI Changes

---

### GetCaps

A new cap for this feature will be added to the existing shader
caps query for the GetCaps
DDI:

`D3D12DDICAPS_SHADER_ROVS`

Setting this flag means that the driver/hardware supports ROVs.

---

## D3D11on12 Changes

CheckFeatureSupport will be updated to handle a query for
D3D11_FEATURE_D3D11_OPTIONS2.

---

## HLSL

D3D11 and D3D12 HLSL support is required.

The Raster Ordered Views are declared with the following new HLSL
Objects, and are only allowed in the Pixel Shader:

- `RasterizerOrderedBuffer`
- `RasterizerOrderedByteAddressBuffer`
- `RasterizerOrderedStructuredBuffer`
- `RasterizerOrderedTexture1D`
- `RasterizerOrderedTexture1DArray`
- `RasterizerOrderedTexture2D`
- `RasterizerOrderedTexture2DArray`
- `RasterizerOrderedTexture3D`

---

### Shader IL

Rasterizer Ordered Views are represented in Shader IL using a new
"rasterizer ordered" type declaration flag, '_rov' (similar to the
_glc, i.e. globally coherent, flag):

- `dcl_uav_typed_buffer_rov`
- `dcl_uav_raw_rov`
- `dcl_uav_structured_rov`
- `dcl_uav_typed_texture1d_rov`
- `dcl_uav_typed_texture1darray_rov`
- `dcl_uav_typed_texture2d_rov`
- `dcl_uav_typed_texture2darray_rov`
- `dcl_uav_typed_texture3d_rov`

All operations on any register(s) declared as "rasterizer ordered" must
honor the ordering semantics specified in this document.

# Test Plan

Functional unit tests will be designed to verify all runtime validation
and expected DDI calling behavior. These will need to fully cover the
feature surface area because there will be no D3DTest-provided
functional testing. D3D11 API should be used and run on D3D11on12 to
test D3D12 functionality, but D3D12 tests for failures will need to be
written as well. These tests will be integrated into CIS automatically
based on their directory location.

The D3D Proxy Driver will be used as the underlying driver for unit
testing. It will only mock support this feature since the driver
conformance testing will cover the actual shader execution behavior. We
only need to verify caps reporting and create pixel shader validation.

Ref will not be updated to support this feature.

New HCK test will be implemented to validate driver and hardware
conformance.

---

## Functional / Unit Tests

The functional unit tests will be written in TAEF. Because negatives
must be tested, we need D3D11 and D3D12 API tests. We must also ensure
D3D11on12 works for positives. D3DDriver will be used for D3D11 DDI call
verification, DDIFilter and WARP will be used for D3D12 and D3D11on12.

Functional unit tests will cover CheckFeatureSupport, and
CreatePixelShader validation:

- CheckFeatureSupport testing will:
  - Check positives to ensure driver support is correctly surfaced
        (incl. pfnGetCaps DDI call).
  - Check negatives caused by lack of feature level and/or WDDM
        version requirements.
  - Check negatives caused by lack of driver support.
- CreatePixelShader testing will:
  - Check positives by creating a pixel shader that uses one of the
        new ROV HLSL types.
  - Check negatives caused by lack of feature level and/or WDDM
        version requirements.
  - Check negatives caused by lack of driver support.

## IHV-Bring-up Test

The TAEF unit test to unblock IHV development will be designed to verify
that two overlapping Pixel Shader invocations are correctly ordered when
RasterizerOrderedBuffer is used. This test must run on D3D11 and
D3D11on12 to cover D3D11 and D3D12.

To accomplish this, the following is required:

1) Pixel Shader that uses RasterizerOrderedBuffer
2) UAV bound to Pixel Shader RasterizerOrderedBuffer with a UINT value
    of 1
3) Draw two overlapping primitives that both cover the center of a 1x1
    RT: T1 and T2.
4) When Pixel Shader is drawing T1 it must stall and then multiply the
    value in the RasterizerOrderedBuffer by 2.
    a.  To stall the Pixel Shader execution, a (UAV) input value should
        be read and used as the termination condition of a for-loop that
        will decrement a shader literal down to 2, to be used as the
        value in the multiplication. This complexity is required to
        avoid optimizing the stall out of the shader assembly.
5) When Pixel Shader is drawing T2 it must subtract 1 from the value in
    the RasterizerOrderedBuffer.
6) Verify the value in the UAV is 1 (not 0, which would be the case if
    the order was wrong)

In this way, the math should be execute as:

1) 1\*2 = 2

2) 2-1 = 1

If the order is not honored, the math executes as:

1) 1-1 = 0

2) 0 \* 2 = 0

### Windows HCK

The IHV-Bring-up test will be extended to operate on all RO-types (i.e.
RasterizerOrderedBuffer, RasterizerOrderedTexture1D,
RasterizerOrderedTexture2D, etc.).

All HCK Tests will cover D3D12 via D3D11on12.
